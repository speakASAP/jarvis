- Read stdout as JSON; on failure read stderr.error.code and stderr.error.message.\n  \
- Do not edit .lwc/wiki.db or generated Markdown directly; mutate knowledge through lwc commands.\n  \
- Treat `source add` as collection only. A source is integrated only after the ingest loop completes.\n  \
- Ground factual pages with repeated --source IDs and preserve uncertainty in page bodies.\n  \
- Search compiled pages first, inspect cited sources when needed, and write durable answers back as kind=query pages.\n  \
- Current stores stay read-only for read commands; a writable legacy store is migrated transactionally once before reading.\n  \
- Run lint after a batch of changes; compact storage only during an idle maintenance window.\n\n\
Persistent workflow:\n  \
1. lwc init\n  \

7. lwc ingest complete <SOURCE_ID>\n  \

project  Use the nearest ancestor .lwc/wiki.db (default).\n  \
